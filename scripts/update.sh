# 1. Gets the name of the pods starting with 'planes-readsb-' and put it in a variable called 'PODS'
# 2. For each pod, list the folders
#    like this: kubectl exec -ti $POD -- find /var/globe_history/$YEAR -maxdepth 2
# 3. For each folder, check if it's a path like /var/globe_history/YYYY/MM/DD and that it is older than 1 day.
# 4. If it is, check if we already backed it up.
#    We can check by seeing if there is a GitHub Release vYYYY.MM.DD
# 5. If we haven't backed it up,
#    5.1. MKTEMP a folder
#    5.2. kubectl cp the folder to the temp folder
#    5.3. tar the temp folder
#    5.4. Try splitting the tar since it might be too big for GitHub (2GB limit)

#    5.7. Commit the README.md
